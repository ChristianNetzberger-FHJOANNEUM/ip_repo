   --Write Data Channel
   ----------------------

   --The write data will continually try to push write data across the interface.

   --The amount of data accepted will depend on the AXI slave and the AXI
   --Interconnect settings, such as if there are FIFOs enabled in interconnect.

   --Note that there is no explicit timing relationship to the write address channel.
   --The write channel has its own throttling flag, separate from the AW channel.

   --Synchronization between the channels must be determined by the user.

   --The simpliest but lowest performance would be to only issue one address write
   --and write data burst at a time.

   --In this example they are kept in sync by using the same address increment
   --and burst sizes. Then the AW and W channels have their transactions measured
   --with threshold counters as part of the user logic, to make sure neither 
   --channel gets too far ahead of each other.

   --Forward movement occurs when the write channel is valid and ready

     wnext <= M_AXI_WREADY and axi_wvalid;

   --Example design throttling
   ----------------------------------

   -- For maximum port throughput, this user example code will try to allow
   -- each channel to run as independently and as quickly as possible.

   -- However, there are times when the flow of data needs to be throtted by
   -- the user application. This example application requires that data is
   -- not read before it is written and that the write channels do not
   -- advance beyond an arbitrary threshold (say to prevent an 
   -- overrun of the current read address by the write address).

   -- From AXI4 Specification, 13.13.1: \"If a master requires ordering between 
   -- read and write transactions, it must ensure that a response is received 
   -- for the previous transaction before issuing the next transaction.\"

   -- This example accomplishes this user application throttling through:
   -- -Reads wait for writes to fully complete
   -- -Address writes wait when not read + issued transaction counts pass 
   -- a parameterized threshold
   -- -Writes wait when a not read + active data burst count pass 
   -- a parameterized threshold

    -- write_burst_counter counter keeps track with the number of burst transaction initiated             
    -- against the number of burst transactions the master needs to initiate
